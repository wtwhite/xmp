# xmp

The XMP program from the 2011 Bioinformatics paper "Faster exact maximum parsimony search with XMP". Or at least I hope so -- this was resurrected from an old laptop after the original site http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wtwhite/xmp became unavailable.

I have dumped this here in the state I found it in, untouched since 2010, and it is probably going to be a nightmare to try to get it to build. If anyone makes progress on this, please let me know! Pull requests happily accepted.
